# Literature Survey: Granularity Conditioning and Hierarchical Agents

## Motivation

The project's central hypothesis is that explicitly conditioning an LLM agent on its current
operating granularity (global / subtask / atomic) improves task success, calibration, and
request-vs-act discrimination. Before designing the Phase 2 baseline experiment we need
literature grounding on three threads: how prior work has framed and operationalised
"granularity" or "scope" labels for hierarchical agents, what hierarchical task decomposition
schemas exist in the four benchmark sources, and which uncertainty-calibration metrics have
been used in agent settings (in particular, definitions and prior measurements of the
overconfident error rate). The survey output anchors every later planning decision and lets us
cite prior work in the Phase 4 paper-ready report.

## Scope

* Granularity / scope / scale conditioning in LLM agents and prompt engineering. Include any
  work that varies the level of abstraction at which an agent receives its instructions, even
  if the authors do not use the word "granularity".
* Hierarchical task decomposition: papers proposing two-, three-, or n-level decompositions
  for benchmarks similar to those in this project (FrontierScience-Olympiad, WorkArena++,
  SWE-bench Verified, tau-bench).
* Uncertainty calibration in LLM agents: confidence elicitation methods, definitions of
  overconfident error rate, calibration plots and metrics, and prior reports on how
  calibration changes with prompt design.
* The four roadmap benchmarks themselves: their official task structures, scoring conventions,
  and any published results that bracket what counts as competitive performance.

Out of scope: training-time techniques (RL, gradient-based fine-tuning), non-English
benchmarks, production deployment papers — all consistent with the project's Out of Scope
section.

## Approach

1. Run the standard `/research-papers` and `/research-internet` stages with the three thread
   queries above. Use the `download-paper` skill for any candidate paper found via search.
2. Produce paper assets under `assets/paper/` for at least 10 highly relevant papers, each
   with a summary that conforms to the paper asset specification.
3. Aggregate findings into `research/research_papers.md` with a section per thread:
   granularity conditioning, hierarchical decomposition, calibration metrics, benchmark
   grounding.
4. Connect each thread back to the project's research questions and explicitly flag (a) any
   prior work that already answers a research question, (b) any methodological choices the
   survey resolves for Phase 2, and (c) any open questions to surface as suggestions.

## Expected Outputs

* At least 10 paper assets under `assets/paper/<paper_id>/` with `details.json`, summary, and
  PDF or markdown file.
* `research/research_papers.md` and `research/research_internet.md` synthesising the survey.
* `results/results_summary.md` with a thread-by-thread takeaway and explicit follow-up
  suggestions for the next brainstorm session (typically: which benchmarks to deprioritise,
  which conditioning prompts to adopt, which calibration metric to register as a project
  metric).
* `results/suggestions.json` with concrete follow-up ideas surfaced by the survey.

## Compute and Budget

No GPU. Anthropic API only (the project's `available_services` list dropped `openai_api` until
an API key is provided). Estimated cost: under 5 USD for paper summarisation through Claude.

## Dependencies and Cross-References

* No task dependencies. Independent of T2.
* Reads `project/description.md` for research questions and success criteria.
* The project's pre-existing `project/data/annotation_pilot/tasks_annotated.jsonl` should be
  inspected during the survey to ground discussion of benchmark coverage.

## Key Questions

1. What prior work explicitly compares scope-aware vs. scope-unaware vs. scope-mismatched LLM
   agents on multi-step benchmarks, and what effect sizes did they report?
2. What definitions of "overconfident error rate" exist in the agent calibration literature,
   and which is most appropriate for our Metric 2 specification?
3. What hierarchical decomposition schemas are already published for FrontierScience-Olympiad,
   WorkArena++, SWE-bench Verified, and tau-bench, and how do they map to our global / subtask
   / atomic split?
4. Are the WorkArena++ and tau-bench benchmarks truly inaccessible (as the existing pilot data
   suggests), or are there standard distribution channels we missed?

# Brainstorm Session 1

## Context

This is the first brainstorm session for the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project,
executed inline as part of `/setup-project` immediately after `meta/` was populated. The
project has no completed tasks, no suggestions, and no answer assets, so the session focused
on Round 1 (propose first tasks). Rounds 2 (suggestion cleanup) and 3 (confirmation) had
nothing to clean up and proceeded straight to confirmation.

## Decisions

The researcher accepted two child tasks for immediate creation:

* `t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning` — survey papers on granularity / scope /
  scale conditioning in LLM agents, hierarchical task decomposition, and uncertainty
  calibration metrics.
* `t0003_download_benchmark_subsets` — wire up access to subsets of the four roadmap
  benchmarks (FrontierScience-Olympiad, WorkArena++, SWE-bench Verified, tau-bench) at
  difficulty 4-8 decisions per task.

Two further candidate tasks (`hierarchical_annotation_pilot` and
`baseline_scope_experiment_smoke_test`) were discussed in detail but deferred — the researcher
will review T1 and T2 outputs before committing.

## Why these tasks first

T1 and T2 are independent and low-cost. T1 anchors later planning decisions in the literature;
T2 unblocks every Phase 1 annotation extension and every Phase 2/3 experiment. Running them in
parallel keeps the project moving while preserving the option to redirect after the literature
survey.

## Out-of-band notes

* `project/data/annotation_pilot/tasks_annotated.jsonl` already contains 115 LLM-annotated
  rows, but tau-bench and WorkArena++ rows use HumanEval and Mind2Web proxies because the real
  benchmarks were "unavailable on HF" at original-annotation time. T2 must address this
  directly.
* The `available_services` list dropped `openai_api` during setup because no API key was
  provided; `anthropic_api` remains. T1 and T2 should plan their LLM use accordingly.
