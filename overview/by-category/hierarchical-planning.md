WorkArena++ extends the 33 atomic WorkArena task families into 682 compositional
knowledge-work tasks evaluated on the same ServiceNow + BrowserGym substrate. The motivation
is that prior benchmarks measure either atomic or end-to-end success but rarely the gap
between the two — the gap that explains why agents that handle individual web actions still
cannot complete realistic enterprise workflows.

Methodologically, the paper composes WorkArena atomic operations into multi-step workflows
whose ground-truth solutions exercise five skill axes: planning, problem-solving,
logical/arithmetic reasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding. Evaluation uses the
BrowserGym harness with SOTA LLMs, VLMs, and human workers as comparison points. A trace
generator produces synthetic gold action sequences for fine-tuning research.

The headline finding is a **considerable gap** to full automation across all evaluated
systems, with detailed per-skill breakdowns in the NeurIPS 2024 D&B paper. The
atomic-vs-compositional gap is the central observation — agents that succeed on individual web
actions consistently fail to coordinate them across a multi-step workflow.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, WorkArena++ is the most directly
relevant single benchmark. It is the strongest test bed for sub-hypothesis 1 (gains
concentrated where local execution needs information not needed for higher-level planning); it
shares a harness with WorkArena, lowering integration cost; and its synthetic trace generator
can supply gold atomic actions to complement the project's manual global/subtask annotation.
The project should treat WorkArena++ as the primary metric source for Phase 2 stratified
analysis.

Reflexion is a language-agent framework that adds a verbal self-reflection loop on top of
ReAct-style prompting agents. After each trial, the agent writes a free-form natural-language
critique of its own behavior, stores the critique in an episodic memory buffer, and uses the
buffer as additional context for the next trial. No model weights are updated — the learning
is entirely linguistic.

Methodologically, Reflexion has three components: an actor (ReAct policy), an evaluator
(scalar or free-form feedback), and a reflector (LLM in critique mode). The architecture is
evaluated on HumanEval coding, AlfWorld sequential decision-making, and HotpotQA reasoning,
with ablations on feedback type, feedback source, and reflection horizon.

The headline result is **91% pass@1 on HumanEval** with GPT-4 + Reflexion, an **+11 absolute**
gain over vanilla GPT-4 (80%) without any weight updates. Free-form text feedback outperforms
scalar feedback; internally simulated feedback is nearly as effective as external feedback;
last-trial reflection captures most of the gain.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, Reflexion's actor/evaluator/reflector
decomposition aligns with the global/subtask/atomic schema and is a strong template for the
scope-aware (A) condition's between-trial component. However, including cross-trial memory in
Phase 2 would conflate scope conditioning with episodic memory; Reflexion should be treated as
a Phase 3 ablation that tests whether memory adds gains *on top of* scope conditioning, not as
the Phase 2 baseline.

Plan-and-Solve (PS) prompting is a zero-shot prompting technique that explicitly forces a
language model to first produce a plan, then execute the plan step by step. The motivation is
that Zero-shot-CoT — while a powerful zero-shot baseline — exhibits three error modes:
calculation errors, missing-step errors, and semantic-misunderstanding errors. PS targets the
missing-step mode by demanding an explicit plan; PS+ extends to calculation errors via
additional in-prompt instructions to "pay attention to correct numerical calculation."

Methodologically, PS is a single-prompt template that instructs the model to plan-then-solve.
Evaluation covers ten datasets across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning, all in
zero-shot mode with GPT-3 text-davinci-003 as the primary model. PS+ adds more detailed
per-stage instructions.

The headline outcome is **consistent improvement over Zero-shot-CoT across all 10 datasets**,
with PS+ achieving **comparable performance to 8-shot manual CoT** on GSM8K (≈58% vs ≈57%) — a
strong zero-shot result that eliminates the manual exemplar-curation cost. PS+ is available in
LangChain core as Plan-and-Execute and has been adopted in production agent systems.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, PS is the canonical scope-unaware (B)
baseline for Phase 2. Its two-stage plan-then-solve structure is the closest published
analogue to the project's scope-aware (A) condition without the explicit granularity tags. The
project should reuse LangChain's Plan-and-Execute implementation, log both stages separately,
and measure how much of PS's gain over CoT comes from the plan-execute separation alone — that
delta is the lower bound for the scope-aware (A) condition's expected gain.

| **Full summary** | [`summary.md`](../../tasks/t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning/assets/paper/10.48550_arXiv.2210.03629/summary.md) |

ReAct introduces an agent prompting paradigm where the language model alternates between
Thought tokens (free-form reasoning) and Action tokens (calls to external tools or
environments). The motivation is that prior work treated reasoning (chain-of-thought) and
acting (tool-use) as separate problems, missing the synergy where reasoning helps the agent
track and update its plan while acting lets the agent ground its reasoning in real
information.

Methodologically, ReAct uses one or two in-context examples to teach the model the
Thought/Action/Observation pattern, then runs autoregressively until the model emits a Finish
action. No fine-tuning is required. The paper evaluates on HotpotQA, Fever (knowledge tasks)
and ALFWorld, WebShop (interactive decision-making tasks).

The headline result is **+34 absolute** success-rate improvement on ALFWorld and **+10
absolute** on WebShop, both compared to imitation and reinforcement-learning baselines. ReAct
also reduces hallucination on HotpotQA and improves fact-verification on Fever via Wikipedia
API grounding, with the bonus of producing human-interpretable trajectories.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, ReAct is the conceptual ancestor of the
three-level granularity schema. The project's scope-aware (A) condition can be implemented as
a ReAct extension with explicit per-token granularity tags, preserving ReAct's
interpretability while adding scope discipline. The +34 ALFWorld gain is the strongest
published evidence that prompt-only agent improvements can produce large absolute effect sizes
— the project's +5-to-+15 abs targets are conservative against this benchmark.

Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting is a two-stage prompting technique designed to overcome
chain-of- thought's easy-to-hard generalization gap. The first stage decomposes a complex
problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems ordered by difficulty; the second stage solves
each subproblem using the answers to previously solved subproblems as additional context. The
motivation is that CoT performs well on test problems similar to in-context exemplars but
degrades sharply when test problems are harder.

Methodologically, LtM uses the same model (GPT-3 code-davinci-002 in the headline experiments)
in two prompting modes: decomposition and sequential solving. Evaluation covers SCAN
(compositional generalization), GSM8K (math), MultiArith (math), DROP (reading comprehension),
and Last Letter Concatenation (symbolic).

The headline result is **>=99% accuracy on SCAN length-split** with **just 14 exemplars**, vs.
**16% with vanilla chain-of-thought** — a **+83 absolute** gain. Other tasks show smaller but
consistent gains, with the improvement scaling with the easy-to-hard difficulty gap between
exemplars and test problems.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, LtM is the strongest empirical anchor
for the scope-aware (A) condition's expected effect size on hierarchical tasks. The +83
absolute SCAN gain sets the aspirational ceiling; the project's +5-to-+15 abs target on the
four-source composite is conservative against this anchor. Solution-reuse — each subproblem
using prior solutions in its context — is a detail worth replicating in scope-aware (A); pure
decomposition without solution-reuse loses much of LtM's gain.

<summary>🔧 <strong>Add a gold_actions structural-mirror validator for non-empty
global_atomics</strong> (S-0009-02)</summary>

**Kind**: technique | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

The two needs-revision rows on FrontierScience-Olympiad both failed for the same reason: the
annotator emitted hierarchy.global_atomics correctly but produced gold_actions.global_atomics
empty or merged into a subtask. This is a structural-mirror inconsistency, not a content
error. Add a post-parse validator to v2_annotator.py that detects this pattern, re-prompts the
model on just the gold_actions block (or rejects the row to the parse-failure bucket), and
logs the rate. This should bring the FrontierScience-Olympiad accept rate from 67% to ~100%
with zero additional model cost on the happy path.

<summary>📊 <strong>Run a single-blind human review pass on the 115 v2 rows and

**Kind**: evaluation | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

v2 is judged only by a single LLM call per row. The dataset is 'LLM-judge-acceptable' but not
'human-validated'. To upgrade to v3, recruit 1-2 human annotators to review the same 23-row
stratified sample (or all 115 rows for higher precision) and emit acceptable/needs-revision
verdicts. Compute Cohen's kappa between human and the haiku judge to estimate how much of the
+58% v2-vs-v1 aggregate gain is real quality vs judge-LLM agreement-with-itself. Budget
estimate: 4-6 hours of human review time at $50/hour = $200-300.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Add an ablation: tree-schema-with-truncated-text to isolate the
truncation fix from the schema upgrade</strong> (S-0009-04)</summary>

**Kind**: experiment | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

v2 changed two things at once: schema (flat -> tree) and text completeness (truncated 1500
chars -> full). On FrontierScience-Olympiad and WorkArena++ the +67% and +100% deltas could be
entirely from the truncation fix (Xiong2024's prediction) or entirely from the schema upgrade.
Run a third condition: the v2 tree schema but truncate the problem to 1500 chars in both the
annotator and judge prompts. If accept rate drops materially below v2-full-text on
FrontierScience-Olympiad, truncation is the dominant cause; if it stays at v2-full-text
levels, the schema is the dominant cause. Cost ~$2 with haiku.

<summary>📂 <strong>Expand the v2 dataset from 115 rows to >=200 rows by sampling
additional benchmark instances</strong> (S-0009-05)</summary>

**Kind**: dataset | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

The Phase 1 success criterion is >=100 annotated tasks per condition; v2 is at 115 which is
just over the threshold. The downstream Phase 2 experiments need stratification by difficulty
AND by benchmark, which becomes statistically thin at 5-6 rows per stratum. Expand to >=200
rows by sampling 20-25 additional rows from each of the four benchmarks (especially the
smaller ones: SWE-bench Verified, tau-bench). Re-use v2_annotator.py at the same haiku-CLI
rate, ~$5-6 added cost. Inherits S-0005-01.

<summary>📂 <strong>Replace Mind2Web/HumanEval proxy rows with native WorkArena++
and tau-bench data</strong> (S-0015-01)</summary>

**Kind**: dataset | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0015_correct_proxy_benchmark_labels](../../tasks/t0015_correct_proxy_benchmark_labels/)

Variant a of S-0009-06 (now folded into this follow-up). The 26 m2w_* rows in the v2
hierarchical-annotation dataset are Mind2Web data used as a proxy for the gated WorkArena++
split, and the 26 he_* rows are HumanEval data used as a proxy for the gated tau-bench split.
t0015 corrected the labels but did not replace the underlying data. This task should (1)
obtain access to a real WorkArena++ split and a real tau-bench split (both currently gated;
expect a registration / agreement step that must be tracked as an intervention), (2)
re-annotate 26 + 26 rows under the v2 tree schema using the same haiku annotator and judge as
t0009 to keep variant b apples-to-apples, and (3) issue a corrections-overlay against
hierarchical-annotation-v2 that swaps the proxy rows for the native rows. Out of scope: any
change to the FrontierScience-Olympiad or SWE-bench Verified rows.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Defer Reflexion-style episodic memory to a Phase 3
ablation</strong> (S-0002-10)</summary>

**Kind**: experiment | **Priority**: low | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning](../../tasks/t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning/)

Reflexion [Shinn2023] adds verbal self-reflection across trials and reaches 91% pass@1 on
HumanEval vs. 80% for vanilla GPT-4. Including episodic memory in Phase 2 would conflate scope
conditioning with cross-trial memory. Schedule a dedicated Phase 3 ablation that tests whether
Reflexion-style memory adds further gains on top of the scope-aware (A) condition established
in Phase 2.

**Kind**: experiment | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0003_download_benchmark_subsets](../../tasks/t0003_download_benchmark_subsets/)

FrontierScience-Olympiad pilot rows currently lack per-instance step graphs because Olympiad
solutions are graded as final answers. Run a hierarchical-annotation task that decomposes each
problem into global / subtask / atomic steps with gold actions at each level, so Phase 2 can
apply the canonical 4-8 decisions filter consistently across all four benchmarks.

[t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1](../../tasks/t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1/)

Extend the v1 pilot to >=200 rows by re-running the upstream pilot pipeline with a stricter
retry policy (eliminate the 11 FrontierScience-Olympiad rows where steps==null), then perform
a full human-rater review of every row. Compute inter-rater agreement (Krippendorff's alpha or
Cohen's kappa) between the human rater and the LLM annotator.

<summary>🔧 <strong>Reconcile WorkArena++ flat-action sequences with the three-level
schema</strong> (S-0005-03)</summary>

[t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1](../../tasks/t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1/)

The judge rejected all three WorkArena++ rows because the upstream annotation lacks
`conceptual` nodes, causing the mapper to emit empty subtask lists. Investigate whether the
WorkArena++ source carries an implicit subtask boundary (e.g., screen transitions) that can be
detected automatically, or alternatively change the v2 schema to accept flat atomic-only rows
as a distinct hierarchy_kind. Document the chosen approach and update the mapper.

<summary>🔧 <strong>Extend the library to support a granularity that varies within
a single run</strong> (S-0006-05)</summary>

**Kind**: technique | **Priority**: low | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0006_scope_aware_react_library](../../tasks/t0006_scope_aware_react_library/)

Currently ScopeAwareReactAgent takes one fixed granularity for an entire run. A natural
extension is to let the agent emit a granularity transition (e.g., start global, drop to
subtask once a plan is established, drop to atomic during execution). Add a model-driven mode
where the parser also accepts <transition_to:subtask> markers and the agent updates the active
granularity per turn. This is a research extension worth Phase 2 ablation.

Build the experiment harness that runs all three libraries (scope_aware_react_v1,
scope_unaware_planandsolve_v1, and the planned matched-mismatch library) on a fixed benchmark
slice with a single shared LLM provider, recording trajectory_records.jsonl per condition and
computing the registered metrics task_success_rate, avg_decisions_per_task, and
overconfident_error_rate per condition. The harness must depend on this library only via the
trajectory schema, never via internal helpers, to preserve isolation.

The PS+ instruction string in scope_unaware_planandsolve_v1 was sourced through the t0002
paper summary, which was itself grounded only in the abstract because the PDF download failed
in t0002. A small download-paper task should re-attempt the download against arXiv:2305.04091
and verify that the prompt text in code/planandsolve.py matches the published version
verbatim. If it diverges, file a correction.
