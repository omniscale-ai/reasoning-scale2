tau-bench introduces a tool-agent-user interaction benchmark in two simulated customer-service
domains (retail and airline). The motivation is that prior tool-use benchmarks fail to test
two critical capabilities for production agents: dynamic interaction with a human user
(simulated here by another LLM) and adherence to domain-specific policy documents that
constrain allowable actions.

Methodologically, each task pairs a user-goal database state, an LLM-roleplayed user persona,
and a policy document. The agent conducts a multi-turn conversation, calls tools as needed,
and attempts to reach the goal state without policy violations. Evaluation compares the final
database state with the annotated goal. The novel pass^k metric runs `k` independent rollouts
and measures the fraction of tasks where every rollout succeeds — exposing inconsistency that
pass@1 hides.

The headline finding is that even state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o) achieve **under 50%
pass@1** and **pass^8 below 25% in retail**, indicating that current frontier agents are both
moderately-capable and substantially unreliable. The gap between pass@1 and pass^8 is the core
diagnostic.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, tau-bench is the canonical
request-vs-act benchmark — most of its failures stem from agents that proceed without
sufficient information rather than asking the simulated user. This makes tau-bench the primary
test bed for Metric 3. The project should also adopt the pass^k metric as a project-wide
reliability signal, especially in the Phase 4 paper-ready report where overall claims about
scope-conditioning gains must be robust to single-rollout luck.

<summary>📊 <strong>Register pass^k as a project metric for reliability
reporting</strong> (S-0002-01)</summary>

**Kind**: evaluation | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning](../../tasks/t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning/)

tau-bench [Yao2024] introduces pass^k, a metric that measures whether an agent succeeds across
k independent rollouts. The 25-percentage-point gap between pass@1 and pass^8 in retail
demonstrates that single-rollout pass@1 systematically overstates agent reliability. The
project should register a pass_at_k metric (with k=1, 8) under meta/metrics/ to complement
task_success_rate. This enables Phase 4 paper-ready claims to be robust to single-rollout
luck.

<summary>📚 <strong>Build benchmark-specific tool registries for the four roadmap
benchmarks</strong> (S-0006-01)</summary>

**Kind**: library | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0006_scope_aware_react_library](../../tasks/t0006_scope_aware_react_library/)

scope_aware_react_v1 accepts an arbitrary tool_registry but ships none. Phase 2 needs
registries for FrontierScience-Olympiad (calculator, search, paper lookup), WorkArena++
(browser, form filler, table lookup), SWE-bench Verified (file read, file write, run tests,
git diff), and tau-bench (DB query, API call, customer-action stubs). Each should be its own
write-library task that imports scope_aware_react_v1 and registers a registry with consistent
naming conventions.
