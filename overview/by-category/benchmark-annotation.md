SWE-bench Verified is a 500-instance human-validated subset of SWE-bench produced by OpenAI's
Preparedness team in collaboration with the original SWE-bench authors. The motivation is that
the parent benchmark of 2,294 problems contains some items with ambiguous issue descriptions
or flaky tests, which add noise to capability measurements at the frontier.

Methodologically, 93 expert software engineers each reviewed candidate problems on three axes:
(a) clear instructions, (b) correct test patches, (c) reproducible environments. Three
independent reviewers per problem; only problems passing all three axes from all three
reviewers were included. The harness, Docker images, and resolve@1 scoring are identical to
the parent benchmark.

The headline outcome is that Verified has become the de facto standard subset for measuring
frontier autonomous-software-engineering capability in 2024-2026. Modern models score far
above the parent benchmark's 1.96% Claude 2 baseline — Claude Mythos Preview leads at
**93.9%** (April 2026). OpenAI's own April 2026 commentary noted that this saturation may
limit Verified's usefulness as a frontier-capability measurement going forward.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, SWE-bench Verified is the canonical
atomic-execution slot in the Phase 2 composite benchmark. Its 500-instance size is tractable
for multiple-condition evaluation, the human validation removes benchmark noise, and
stratified reporting is essential because Verified's >90%-achievable ceiling would otherwise
drown out FrontierMath's <2% baseline. The project should plan a fallback to SWE-bench
Multimodal or SWE-bench Pro if Verified saturates further before Phase 2 completes.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Re-run v2 annotator with claude-sonnet-4-6 via direct API to
disentangle schema vs model effect</strong> (S-0009-01)</summary>

**Kind**: experiment | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

The v2 annotator was switched from sonnet to haiku to fit the $15 task budget under Claude
Code CLI overhead. The v2-vs-v1 accept rate delta therefore conflates the schema upgrade (flat
-> tree) with a model downgrade (sonnet -> haiku). Re-run all 115 rows on claude-sonnet-4-6
using the direct Anthropic API (no CLI), where per-call cost is ~$0.02 and 115 rows costs
~$2.30. Compare the resulting per-benchmark accept rate against both v1 (sonnet, flat) and
v2-haiku (haiku, tree) to attribute the +33% to +100% deltas between schema and model
contributions.

<summary>🔧 <strong>Add a gold_actions structural-mirror validator for non-empty
global_atomics</strong> (S-0009-02)</summary>

**Kind**: technique | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

The two needs-revision rows on FrontierScience-Olympiad both failed for the same reason: the
annotator emitted hierarchy.global_atomics correctly but produced gold_actions.global_atomics
empty or merged into a subtask. This is a structural-mirror inconsistency, not a content
error. Add a post-parse validator to v2_annotator.py that detects this pattern, re-prompts the
model on just the gold_actions block (or rejects the row to the parse-failure bucket), and
logs the rate. This should bring the FrontierScience-Olympiad accept rate from 67% to ~100%
with zero additional model cost on the happy path.

<summary>📊 <strong>Run a single-blind human review pass on the 115 v2 rows and
report human-vs-judge agreement (Cohen's kappa)</strong> (S-0009-03)</summary>

**Kind**: evaluation | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

v2 is judged only by a single LLM call per row. The dataset is 'LLM-judge-acceptable' but not
'human-validated'. To upgrade to v3, recruit 1-2 human annotators to review the same 23-row
stratified sample (or all 115 rows for higher precision) and emit acceptable/needs-revision
verdicts. Compute Cohen's kappa between human and the haiku judge to estimate how much of the
+58% v2-vs-v1 aggregate gain is real quality vs judge-LLM agreement-with-itself. Budget
estimate: 4-6 hours of human review time at $50/hour = $200-300.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Add an ablation: tree-schema-with-truncated-text to isolate the
truncation fix from the schema upgrade</strong> (S-0009-04)</summary>

**Kind**: experiment | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

v2 changed two things at once: schema (flat -> tree) and text completeness (truncated 1500
chars -> full). On FrontierScience-Olympiad and WorkArena++ the +67% and +100% deltas could be
entirely from the truncation fix (Xiong2024's prediction) or entirely from the schema upgrade.
Run a third condition: the v2 tree schema but truncate the problem to 1500 chars in both the
annotator and judge prompts. If accept rate drops materially below v2-full-text on
FrontierScience-Olympiad, truncation is the dominant cause; if it stays at v2-full-text
levels, the schema is the dominant cause. Cost ~$2 with haiku.

<summary>📂 <strong>Expand the v2 dataset from 115 rows to >=200 rows by sampling
additional benchmark instances</strong> (S-0009-05)</summary>

**Kind**: dataset | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

The Phase 1 success criterion is >=100 annotated tasks per condition; v2 is at 115 which is
just over the threshold. The downstream Phase 2 experiments need stratification by difficulty
AND by benchmark, which becomes statistically thin at 5-6 rows per stratum. Expand to >=200
rows by sampling 20-25 additional rows from each of the four benchmarks (especially the
smaller ones: SWE-bench Verified, tau-bench). Re-use v2_annotator.py at the same haiku-CLI
rate, ~$5-6 added cost. Inherits S-0005-01.

<summary>📂 <strong>Replace the WorkArena++ proxy and HumanEval-as-tau-bench-proxy
rows with the actual benchmark data</strong> (S-0009-06)</summary>

**Kind**: dataset | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-30 | **Source**:
[t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2](../../tasks/t0009_hierarchical_annotation_v2/)

Inspecting the v1 (and now v2) rows shows the 'WorkArena++' rows are actually Mind2Web proxy
data and the 'tau-bench' rows are HumanEval proxy data — neither benchmark is loaded directly
because of access restrictions noted in the v1 task. For Phase 2 the benchmark provenance
matters: agent-evaluation results on Mind2Web do not generalize to WorkArena++. Either (a)
acquire WorkArena++ and tau-bench proper and re-annotate those rows, or (b) rename the
benchmark fields to match what is actually stored (Mind2Web, HumanEval) and update downstream
consumers. This is necessary before any Phase 2 paper claim about WorkArena++ performance.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Derive step graphs for FrontierScience-Olympiad rows</strong>
(S-0003-04)</summary>

**Kind**: experiment | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0003_download_benchmark_subsets](../../tasks/t0003_download_benchmark_subsets/)

FrontierScience-Olympiad pilot rows currently lack per-instance step graphs because Olympiad
solutions are graded as final answers. Run a hierarchical-annotation task that decomposes each
problem into global / subtask / atomic steps with gold actions at each level, so Phase 2 can
apply the canonical 4-8 decisions filter consistently across all four benchmarks.

<summary>📂 <strong>Hierarchical annotation v2: scale to >=200 rows with full human
review</strong> (S-0005-01)</summary>

**Kind**: dataset | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1](../../tasks/t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1/)

Extend the v1 pilot to >=200 rows by re-running the upstream pilot pipeline with a stricter
retry policy (eliminate the 11 FrontierScience-Olympiad rows where steps==null), then perform
a full human-rater review of every row. Compute inter-rater agreement (Krippendorff's alpha or
Cohen's kappa) between the human rater and the LLM annotator.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Remediate proxy benchmark naming and task_id
non-uniqueness</strong> (S-0005-04)</summary>

**Kind**: dataset | **Priority**: medium | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1](../../tasks/t0005_hierarchical_annotation_pilot_v1/)

The pilot file uses tau-bench and WorkArena++ as proxies but task_id prefixes are still `he_*`
(HumanEval) and `m2w_*` (Mind2Web) from earlier drafts; additionally 14 of 115 task_ids are
duplicated. Re-key the source data with synthetic per-row UUIDs and align task_id prefixes
with the actual benchmark slugs (`tau_*`, `wa_*`).
