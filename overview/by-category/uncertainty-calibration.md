Xiong et al. address the calibration gap in modern LLMs: verbalized confidence is
systematically higher than actual accuracy, making it an unreliable signal for any system that
needs to abstain or escalate based on uncertainty. The motivation is that previous calibration
methods relied on white-box access to internal logits or model fine-tuning, neither of which
is available for closed-source commercial APIs.

Methodologically, the paper proposes a three-component black-box framework: prompting strategy
(vanilla, human-inspired, CoT, self-probing) × sampling method (single, multiple temperature,
multiple prompts) × aggregation technique (mean, majority vote, self-consistency). The
cross-product is benchmarked on five datasets across reasoning, math, code, factual recall,
and ethics, using five widely-used LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA 2 Chat at three sizes).

The headline findings are (a) LLMs are systematically overconfident when verbalizing
confidence, (b) self-consistency aggregation beats single-sample confidence by **+2 to +8 ECE
points**, (c) larger models calibrate better, (d) human-inspired prompting ("low / medium /
high with justification") outperforms numeric confidence, (e) CoT confidence sometimes worsens
calibration counterintuitively.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, this paper is the canonical calibration
reference for Metric 2 (overconfident error rate). The project should adopt verbalized
confidence + 3-sample self-consistency aggregation as its operational definition, define
overconfident error as `incorrect AND high_confidence`, and report bucketed ECE plots
alongside single-number ECE. The human-inspired prompt is recommended for the scope-aware (A)
condition's confidence elicitation.

<summary>📚 <strong>Implement verbalized-confidence + 3-sample self-consistency
aggregator for Metric 2</strong> (S-0002-02)</summary>

**Kind**: library | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-29 | **Source**:
[t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning](../../tasks/t0002_literature_survey_granularity_conditioning/)

Xiong2024 establishes that single-sample verbalized confidence is poorly calibrated and that
3-sample self-consistency aggregation reduces ECE by 2-8 points. The project should commit to
this protocol for Metric 2 (overconfident error rate). This task would specify the
human-inspired confidence prompt template (low/medium/high + brief justification), implement
the self-consistency aggregator, and validate calibration on a small held-out set before Phase
2 launches.
