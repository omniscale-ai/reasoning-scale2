The paper introduces FrontierMath, a research-mathematician-grade math reasoning benchmark
designed to evaluate frontier LLMs on problems that require hours to days of human expert
effort. The motivation is the saturation of prior math benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH) by SOTA models
and the contamination risk of using publicly available problems for evaluation.

The benchmark is built by commissioning hundreds of original, unpublished problems from expert
mathematicians, with programmatic answer-checking that scales to repeated automated runs.
Problems span number theory, real analysis, algebraic geometry, and category theory;
difficulty tiers cover undergraduate through research level. Endorsements from Fields
Medalists (Tao, Gowers, Borcherds) characterize the upper-tier problems as exceptionally
challenging.

The headline result is that current state-of-the-art models solve **under 2% of problems** at
release, revealing a large gap between AI and expert-mathematician performance. This is the
hardest published math benchmark to date.

For the granularity-aware hierarchical agents project, FrontierMath is the canonical
instantiation of the FrontierScience-Olympiad slot named in `project/description.md`. The <2%
baseline means the benchmark contributes mainly to the failure tail of the composite Phase 2
benchmark, and any per-condition (scope-aware vs. scope-unaware) effect must be measured
against a near-zero floor — which makes per-source stratification mandatory. Access via Epoch
AI's evaluation pipeline is a known operational risk for the t0003 download-dataset task.
